Hey there! My name is Jake. I'm a DevOps Engineer turned DevRel. 

I'm not what you would call a "natural". I was a high school teacher in Spain, before I changed careers and dove head first into tech. 

I remember while studying for cloud certs and playing around with dummy projects that I kept on having the same recurring thoughts. "Ahhhhh, ok I get it know. If only somebody could have explained it to me like THAT!". 

I'm sure that it was mostly my fault for struggling or not learning on the first try. Regardless though, I found that there were alternatives ways to explain cloud, networking, security, webdev concepts that would have made me learn quicker. 

Finding these alternative ways and sharing them through blog posts and videos is what excited me lately. Even if you are a "natural techie" or a learner that is taking it slow. I invite you to join me for the ride as we learn and grow together. 

Peace,

Jake.
